# Speech-synth
Linear Predictive Speech Synthesizer 

The project aims to show one of the digital signal-processing techniques that can first analyse the signal and then model and synthesise the signal. In this project, a source-filter model is created to achieve all the requirements to create a replica of a human speech signal with vowel formants using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients for both analysis and synthesis.
